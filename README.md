# Habit_Tracker
Habit Tracker web application using Flask, designed to empower users in effectively managing their routines. Users can seamlessly add, delete, and update habits, enabling them to stay firmly on the path of progress.

The code is based on studying the "Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python in 2022" course on Udemy.

### Improvement potentials:
1. Unable to delete or edit the habit we added.
2. Unable to set the start/end date of the habit. If we add one habit, it takes the selected date as a start date and the habit exists infinitely.
3. When we mark the habit as completed, it won't let me uncheck the checkbox. 

### Added features:
1. Cancel checkbox
2. Make the whole block clickable
3. Make habit edit&deleteable.
4. Add a function to determine if the invalid string is passed through input. 
5. Add a function to add habits with date range

This is my second Flask Project built on Feb/20/2023
